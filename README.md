# AWS-BuildOn-2020

## Introduction
My Team won 2nd place in AWS BuildOn 2020 with a visitor management system for Farrer Park Hospital. It manages the entry of visitors using IoT with contact tracing (tracking the rooms that each visitor visits). On the visitor app, visitors can book slots to visit patients. The uses machine learning to recommend time slots for efficient crowd management in the pandemic. Video feed analysis in each ward also tracks the safe management measures and number of visitors in each ward in realtime.
